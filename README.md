# Experiment: Model Jore 3.x data as Transmodel

This project attempts to a) model the legacy Jore 3.x database entities as immutable DTOs, and b) transform those DTOs to JAXB objects for XML serialization using the Transmodel schema.

The mapping between Jore and Transmodel entities follows the [Netex_SimpleNetwork_1.xml](https://github.com/NeTEx-CEN/NeTEx/blob/master/examples/functions/simpleNetwork/Netex_SimpleNetwork_1.xml) example.
